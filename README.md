# Pruning_with_tensorflow
Compressing the model with help of TensorFlow pruning library 

Dataset Used :- Fashion MNIST Keras

Accuracy and size comparision of normal and pruned model can be shown below.

```diff
! Note :
```
1. I am not trying to fine tune this model as it is not the motive of this case study .
2. There is also a minute decrease in prediction time as i was only predicting one data point but when scaled up, it will create a pretty good difference.
3. Major difference can be seen in the decrease in file size of model which is huge.
